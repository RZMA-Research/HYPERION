# HYPERION
HYPERION is an experemental project that aims to let you control a drone in VR (or via another device but isn't the primary focus).
This repo can be split into two parts: CORE and the various Controllers.

## What is a "Drone Device"
A drone device is a Trilobot as of writing which is a small IOT device however due to its small size and other cost cutting measures it's not ideal, but its good enough for a Prototype. Eventually though we should be moving to a custom DIY solution.

# HYPERION CORE
This is API Server that runs on drone device, Hosting an API Interface with the drone.
Eventually it will be a one click install for the drone device)

# CONTROLLERS

## HYPERION VR (Recomeneded)
Control HYPERION devices via a VR Device (Quest 2 for now)

## HYPERION KB (Unsupported)
Quickly test HYPERION using a quick and dirty C# Project.
This isn't supported.
